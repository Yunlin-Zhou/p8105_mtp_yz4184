## Describe the data cleaning process

According to the setting in the original table, I replaced the representative number with accurate range, and fill in missing values with data. Also I changed column names into lowercase letters and _. I relocated the column orders and reorder the rows by sex and age. 

## Describe the resulting dataset

```{r results='hide', echo = FALSE}

ncol(horns_df)
nrow(horns_df)
count(horns_df,sex)
count(horns_df, age_group)
```

There are `ncol(horns_df)` variables and `nrow(horns_df)` participants which included 614 female and 607 male. There are 2 people under 18, 303 people from 18 to 30, 204 people from 31 to 40, 207 people from 41 to 50, 200 people from 51 to 60 and 305 people above 60. The key vairaibles are sex, FHP and age.
