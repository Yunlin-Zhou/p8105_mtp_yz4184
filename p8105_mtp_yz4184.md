According to the original table, I replaced the group number with
accurate range, and fill in missing values with data. I tidied up column
names, relocated the column orders and reorder the rows by sex and age.
Also make some variables into factors and specified the levels.

The key variables are sex, age, FHP and EOP.

There are 9 variables and 1219 participants which included 614 female
and 607 male.

In the left plot, the distributions are both skewed right. Male are more
likely to have higher FHP size and the data seems to be centered around
30. The data of female seems to be centered around 25.

In the right plot, younger people have the highest EEOP rate than others
and people in 40s have the lowest EEOP rate. Men have higher EEOP rate
than women.

According to the plot, there is no obvious linear association between
EOP size and FHP size. Older people and men are more likely to have
higher EOP size and FHP size.

# Problem 4

According to the data and plots we have, FHP size distribution is skwed
right and the data center around 25 to 30. Men and women have some
slight difference. The highest rate of EEOP is in 18-30 age group and
people in 40s have the lowest rate. As the age grows, the older people
are more likely to have high FHP size and the center of FHP data is
larger than that among yonger people. There is no obvious linear
association between EOP size and FHP size, which means we cannot predict
EEOP through FHP size. Men always have higher EOP and FHP sizes than
women, so the sex might be a factor to predict EEOP. In the article
abstract, it suggested sustained poor posture could be the cause of
young people EOP. However, there is no data provided for posture of
young people related to EOP. We cannot conclude that cell phones are
causing horn growth from the data. Also, in the original data, there are
only 2 subjects under 18. If we need to look up the association between
age and EEOP, it would be better to have more data of teenagers who
always obsessed with cell phone.
